# SPEED-READER (OneWord)

How to use this app: 
1. Ever feel like reading long chunks of small text to be troublesome and tiring? 
2. Did you know humans can actually read up to 600 words per minute? 
3. The NUMBER 1 thing that leads to slow reading speeds is having to constantly move your eyes. This causes strain and reduces reading speed drastically. 
4. OneWord removes this need to move your eyes by rapidly displaying to the user ONE WORD at time at up to 600 words per minute. TRY IT! You will be surprised as to how amazing your eyes actually are. 
5. Simply COPY + PASTE a long chunk of text that you need to read into the textarea and click the play button. From there, sit back, relax, and let the magic take over!
